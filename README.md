# Fruit Prediction using Machine Learning 🍎🍌🍇

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to predict or classify if a gruit is orange or grapefruit  based on various features. It was built as a practice exercise using a Jupyter Notebook and includes steps like data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Features

* Import and analysis of fruit dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data preprocessing and visualization
* Model training using various ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN)
* Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
* Fruit prediction for new inputs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Also clone the raza_stats file because it contains the code for statistics used in the project
3. Run the jupyter notebook on the path you cloned the repository
4. Now run the Project
